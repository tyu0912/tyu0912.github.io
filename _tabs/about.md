I enjoy working at the intersection of data, systems, and people, bringing curiosity, clarity, and pragmatism to complex technical problems. My background spans analytics, infrastructure, and platform engineering, which helps me communicate effectively across disciplines and design solutions that scale. I value collaboration, thoughtful trade‑offs, and continuous learning, and I’m always excited to stay close to the technical work while helping teams do their best work.
