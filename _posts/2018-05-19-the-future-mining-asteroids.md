Ever since Armageddon came out in 1998, I've always wondered what it would be like to mine an asteroid. Crazy. I know. But not really if you consider the fact that there's an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the fact that Elon Musk recently sent a car into space which shows that large equipment can essentially be shuttled. Asteroid composition varies but can contain precious metals as well ranging from nickel, iridium, palladium, platinum, gold, magnesium and other precious metals such as osmium, ruthenium and rhodium. Anyways, you get the idea...
