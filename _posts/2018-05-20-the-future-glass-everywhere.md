It's not unusual to see glass on tall sky scrappers nowadays but sitting at an airport or hospital, you realize how much of our world still 'covered' in opaque materials i.e boring white walls. Obviously, glass can't be used as a covering for all objects but I feel glass technology is definitely overlooked in this world.

Check out [wikipedia artcle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_glass). I bet you weren't expecting such a long article. I sure as hell wasn't when I first looked into it. Check out this video as well.

What potential! I predict a world where glass is way more pervasive than it is now.
