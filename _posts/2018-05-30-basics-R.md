### Setting the active directory to your file location

I started using R in R Studio more seriously a couples weeks ago and so like many times when I had to learn a new language, I had to get used to and learn all the different libraries that are available.

I think one of the cruxes of starting any exploratory analysis is that you have to tell programs where you're getting files. The most direct way, setting the path with a string is fine but I for one cannot stand replacing the location each time I have a new file to work with.

Instead I use this:

```
path = dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path)
setwd(path)
df=read.csv('file.csv')
```

Here, the package is called rstudioapi and the method is called getSourceEditorContext. Setting this makes it so much easier to reuse code. You really shouldn't have to find and select the location each time...

### Adding quadratic in linear modeling

Found that you have to do it like lm(y ~ I(x^2)). Weird that R doesn't give you an error if you do it the normal way x**2.
